<!--bro add all js files to the assest folder then include each of their paths to the angular.json file(in the root front-end module),the paths should go in the script brackets inside-->
<!--also make all non-index html file in the "html pages folder"-->
<!--and dont use the 'sytles.css' file is it is not for global configuration use the 'page specific stylesheets' folder.-->
<!--oh and please avoid touch any json file without tell me and if it changes by itself after 'ng build' command then dont worry-->
<!--speaking of which, even if you run the 'python manage.py runserver' command the changes you made to the src folder will not be shown as the computer deploys the dist folder but-->
<!--dont touch the 'dist' folder that is compiled from the src folder by the computer using the 'ng build' command. use that command when you make changes to 'src' folder then refresh the local server to see changes-->
<!--oh yea, you have to open an integrted terminal to of front-end to run 'ng build' in the terminal. right click the front-end folder and you should see a prompt-->
<!--yea i thing that's it for now, goodluck and let me know if you run into any issue, you will most likely do so if your OS installments is anything as difficult as macOS-->
